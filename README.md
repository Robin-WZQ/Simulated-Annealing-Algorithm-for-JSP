# Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm-for-JSP

**Abstract**ï¼šJob Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a popular optimization problem in computer science and operational research. It focuses on assigning jobs to finite resources at particular times. Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SSA) is a general stochastic global search optimization algorithm based on Monte Carlo iterative solution strategy. Its starting point is based on the similarity between physical solid material annealing processing and general combinatorial optimization problem. Under a certain initial temperature, combined with the probability and decreased temperature, the global optimal solution of the objective function will be found in the solution space. In this paper, I use this algorithm on JSP with ten instances and got the scheduling orders.
